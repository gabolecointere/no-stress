# No stress - Express, MongoDB, JWT API Starter 

## Description

Getting started with Node and Express could be an stressful process. If you have ever used Ruby on Rails, PHP Laravel or any other MVC Framework you'll notice that with Node and Express there's not a single way of doing things and you'll have to take a lot of decisions and install some packages to get up and running. This repository pretends to be an starting point for API Development projects, with all the common packages and boilerplate already set up for you. 

## Includes

- Basic Express set up 

- Mongoose set up for working with MongoDB 

- Basic JWT authentication workflow with Passport

- "Has many" relationship example: User has Items

- Utility methods to ensure consistency through error and success responses (see services/utilService)

## Instalation

Just clone this repo and run npm install or yarn install, and make sure to create a .env file with the variables which fit your environment. There's an example.env file you can use as guide.
